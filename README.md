## Overview

There's just something about "getting hands on".  When it comes to how best we human beings learn, there's simply nothing better.  No book, no video, no blog post can improve upon direct empirical experience.

The Internet of Your Imagination IoT Project is an unique effort targeted at non-developers (eg., executives, managers, sales people) to have a relatively quick, hands-on, no-code-required IoT experience that provides the participant the following:

- A personal narrative about IoT you can share with colleagues and customers
- Direct experience with an IoT device and Microsoft Azure IoT Central.
- A simple technical foundation to incorporate other Azure workloads into a live, working IoT demo environment

> IMPORTANT
> 
> The IoT Personal Learning Project is not meant to be a lab whose instructions you simply follow.  The intent is for you to identify a simple IoT Use Case, related to something at work or home, which you find interesting.

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- [x] Heedless Spirit of Adventure and Openness to Life's Great Potential
- [ ] A basic idea of what use case you'd like to pursue.
    - Don't worry, we'll help you do this in the first section. 
- [ ] An [MXCHIP IoT DevKit Board](http://mxchip.com/az3166).
    - If you don't already have a MXChip IoT Devkit, you can purchase one from one of the on-line stores linked [here](http://mxchip.com/az3166).  They're also typically available on Amazon as well - just search for "MXChip".
- [ ] A USB 2.0 to Micro B Male cable.
    - This should come in the box for the MXChip board, but double-check.
- [ ] An active Microsoft Azure Subscription.
    - If you're unsure whether you do, follow these [steps](/src/documentation/CheckForAzureSubscription.MD) to determine this.
    - If you don't, follow these [Fast Start](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AIRS/BLOG/Pages/Fast%20Start.aspx) instructions to leverage the Azure Internal Registration System (AIRS) to request an internal billing account.
    > NOTE:
    >
    > The primary steps we'll take you through for this project will not necessarily require actual Azure consumption.  However, you are required to have an active Azure subscription.

### How to Begin

#### Step 1 - Choose your Project Use Case

- [ ] Begin [here](ChoosingYourUseCase.MD) to choose your IoT use case for your personal learning project.

#### Step 2 - Create your first IoT Central App

- [ ] Start [here](CreateYourFirstIoTCentralApp.MD) to create your first Azure IoT Central app to connect your MXChip board to.

#### Step 3 - Connect your MXChip Board

- [ ] Click [here](ConnectingTheMXChip.MD) to follow the steps to connect your MXChip board(s).

#### Step 4 - Configure your Azure IoT Central App

- [ ] Now that you've connected your MXChip board, let's [configure](ConfiguringAzureIoTCentral.MD) your Azure IoT Central App to do what you want it to.

#### Step 5 - Show us and your colleagues what you've accomplished!

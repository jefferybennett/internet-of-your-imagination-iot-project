## Thinking Deeply about IoT

While there's a million definitions for the term "IoT", consider this one as we begin thinking about your project use case:

- **IoT**: The "Internet of Things" refers to various types of non-traditional compute devices which enable people and organizations to both understand and interact with the new world in new ways.

### Understanding and Interacting
As you begin to think about your project's use case, think about ways that would be personally compelling for you to either understand or interact with the world in a way you haven't before.

Next, take these ideas and compare them with the [capabilities](#mxchip-board-capabilities) of the MXChip board.  You'll see that what the MXChip board is best at is **understanding** the world through various sensors.

The MXChip board has a whole host of sensors with which we can use to "understand" the world better.  For example, it has temperature, humidity and barometric sensors, which could enable you to monitor a space whose climate must be closely maintained.

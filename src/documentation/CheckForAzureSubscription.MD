## Determine whether you have an existing Azure Subscription

Every service that runs in Microsoft Azure has to be associated to an active subscription for billing purposes.

### If you work for a company which already uses Microsoft Azure

In most cases, it's best to check with your Information Technology department first.  Many companies maintain a separate Azure subscription
for employees that wish to use Microsoft Azure to expiriment and evaluate Azure services.  You can explain to your IT Department that you plan
to leverage Microsoft Azure IoT Central and while you'll be using a FREE pricing tier (by using less than 5 devices in IoT Central), that you'll
need rights to a subscription to create your Microsoft Azure IoT Central App.

### If you know you don't have access to a Microsoft Azure environment

In this case, the two simplest options are: 1) Use an IoT Central trial which will last 7 days, or 2) create an Azure free account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

### If you're a full-time Microsoft Employee

These steps are only for full-time corporate Microsoft employees.
